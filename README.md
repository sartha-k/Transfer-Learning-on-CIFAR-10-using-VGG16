# Transfer Learning on CIFAR-10 using VGG16

## Overview

This project applies transfer learning to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a VGG16 model pretrained on ImageNet. Instead of training a deep network from scratch, the pretrained convolutional features are frozen and only the final classification layer is retrained for the 10-class CIFAR-10 task.

**Final Test Accuracy: 86.45%**

## What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning reuses a model trained on one task as a starting point for a different but related task. The pretrained model has already learned general visual features (edges, textures, shapes) from a large dataset. We adapt it to our task by replacing and retraining only the final layer.

**Two-step process:**
1. **Pretraining** — VGG16 was trained on ImageNet (1000 classes, ~1.2M images)
2. **Fine-tuning** — Freeze the feature extractor, replace the output head, train on CIFAR-10

## Model Architecture

VGG16 has two main blocks:

- **`features`** — 13 convolutional layers with ReLU activations and MaxPooling, progressively expanding channels: 3 → 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 512
- **`classifier`** — Three fully connected layers ending in a 1000-class output

### What was changed

| Component | Original VGG16 | This Project |
|---|---|---|
| `features` | Trainable | **Frozen** (`requires_grad = False`) |
| `classifier[6]` | `Linear(4096 → 1000)` | **Replaced** with `Linear(4096 → 10)` |

Only the classifier head is trained — everything else is locked.

## Data Pipeline

CIFAR-10 images are 32×32 RGB. VGG16 expects 224×224 input. The transform pipeline handles this:

```
Resize(256) → CenterCrop(224) → ToTensor() → Normalize(ImageNet mean/std)
```

ImageNet normalization stats are used (`mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, `std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`) because the frozen features were trained with this distribution.

- **Train set:** 50,000 images, batch size 32, shuffled
- **Test set:** 10,000 images, batch size 32, not shuffled

## Training

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Optimizer | SGD |
| Learning Rate | 0.01 |
| Loss | CrossEntropyLoss |
| Epochs | 10 |
| Device | CUDA (T4 GPU) |

### Training Loss

| Epoch | Loss |
|---|---|
| 1 | 0.6688 |
| 2 | 0.2802 |
| 3 | 0.1455 |
| 5 | 0.0706 |
| 10 | 0.0094 |

Loss drops steadily, indicating the new classifier head converges well on frozen features.

## Results

```
Test Accuracy: 86.45%
```

This is a strong result for only retraining the final layer, demonstrating how effectively ImageNet features transfer to CIFAR-10.

## Key Concepts

**Why freeze the feature layers?**
The conv layers have already learned powerful low-level and mid-level visual representations. Retraining them would be slow, expensive, and risks destroying pretrained knowledge (catastrophic forgetting).

**Why use ImageNet normalization?**
The frozen conv filters were optimized assuming that input distribution. Using different stats would distort activations and degrade the quality of extracted features.

**Why replace only `classifier[6]`?**
The intermediate FC layers (4096→4096) still act as useful general-purpose feature transformers. Only the final mapping needs to change from 1000 ImageNet classes to 10 CIFAR-10 classes.

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision

# Run the notebook
jupyter notebook Transfer_Learning.ipynb
```

GPU is recommended — the notebook was trained on a T4 via Google Colab.
